## Getting Started With Git


**Source Control**

Source control, or version control, is a way of tracking your files progress over time.

It is usually saved in a series of snapshots and branches, which you can move back and forth between.

**What you can do**

- Distribute your file changes
- over time
- Prevent against data
- loss/damage by creating
- backup snapshots
- Manage complex project
- structures

**About Git**

Git is a source control software, which is similar to any other version control system. It was developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds for code maintainence written by many programmers to control workflow and merge conflicts with the code.


**Creating GitHub Account**

If you are reading this on the browser, you are likely reading from GitHub. To create a GitHub acount, go to [https://github.com/login](https://github.com/login) and sign up. After following the procedure, you need to log in into GitHub. Then we set GitHub Desktop Application. 

**What is GitHub Desktop?**

GitHub is an open-source application that lets you interact with GitHub via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of relying on a command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop incentivized you and your team to work together while employing best practices with Git and GitHub.

So, to sum it up, Git is a VCS that helps you manage your code and keep track of it, and GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform that enables developers to manage their Git repositories. GitHub Desktop is an application that lets users interact better with GitHub through a GUI.

**Setting Up GitHub Desktop**

If you are reading here, you have perhaps downloaded GitHub Desktop Application and installed on your computer. If you haven't, download and install the application. The links are provided earlier on this Readme.

Sign in to GitHub: Once the installation is complete, launch GitHub Desktop. If you have a GitHub account, sign in with your username and password. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one by clicking the "Sign up for GitHub" link.

Configure GitHub Desktop: After signing in, you will be prompted to configure GitHub Desktop. You can choose to set your name and email, the default text editor, and other preferences.
